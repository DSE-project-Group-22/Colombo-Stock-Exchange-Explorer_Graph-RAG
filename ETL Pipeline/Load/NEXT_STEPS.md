# Next Steps - Your Load Phase is Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What You Have Now âœ…

Your Load phase has successfully generated **11 Cypher files** ready for Neo4j:

```bash
cd "ETL Pipeline/Load"
ls cypher_queries/
```

These files contain all the queries to create your knowledge graph with:
- Company nodes
- Person nodes (directors, executives)  
- Financial metric nodes
- Business sector nodes
- All relationships between them

## Option 1: Load into Neo4j Database

### Using Neo4j Desktop
1. Open Neo4j Desktop
2. Create a new database
3. Start the database
4. Open Neo4j Browser
5. Copy and paste queries from your `.cypher` files

### Using Command Line
```bash
# Example for one company
cat cypher_queries/DIPPED_PRODUCTS_PLC_Annual_Report_chunks_recursive.cypher | \
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p your_password
```

### Using Python Script
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import os

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", 
                             auth=("neo4j", "your_password"))

cypher_dir = "cypher_queries"
for filename in os.listdir(cypher_dir):
    if filename.endswith('.cypher'):
        with open(os.path.join(cypher_dir, filename), 'r') as f:
            queries = f.read().split(';')
            with driver.session() as session:
                for query in queries:
                    if query.strip():
                        session.run(query)
                        
print("âœ… All data loaded into Neo4j!")
```

## Option 2: Re-run Load Phase

If you want to process the data again or with updated settings:

```bash
cd "ETL Pipeline/Load"
source load_env/bin/activate
python3 generate_cypher_queries.py
```

## Option 3: Process New Company Data

To add more companies:
1. Add new PDF files to `../Extract/annual reports/`
2. Run the Extract phase on new files
3. Run the Transform phase to normalize new data
4. Run the Load phase to generate new Cypher queries

## Your Knowledge Graph Schema

Once loaded into Neo4j, you'll have:

```cypher
// Example queries you can run
MATCH (c:Company) RETURN c.name    // List all companies
MATCH (p:Person)-[:HOLDS_POSITION]->(c:Company) RETURN p.name, c.name  // Directors
MATCH (c:Company)-[:HAS_METRIC]->(m:Metric) WHERE m.name = 'Revenue' RETURN c.name, m.value  // Revenue data
```

## Verification

Check your generated files:
```bash
cd "ETL Pipeline/Load"

# Count total queries across all files
grep -c "MERGE\|MATCH" cypher_queries/*.cypher

# See a sample of generated queries
head -20 cypher_queries/DIPPED_PRODUCTS_PLC_Annual_Report_chunks_recursive.cypher
```
