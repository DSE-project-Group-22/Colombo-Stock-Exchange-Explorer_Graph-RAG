# Annual Report Finder

This service automatically searches for and downloads annual reports from Sri Lankan companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).

- **Selenium web scraping**: Handles dynamic content and anti-bot measures
- **PDF verification**: Ensures downloaded files are valid PDFs
- **Progress tracking**: Shows real-time progress with success/failure counts
- **Docker containerization**: Runs in isolated container with all dependencies

2. **üîç Bing** - Microsoft's search engine, good PDF indexing
3. **üá∑üá∫ Yandex** - Russian search engine, very scraping-friendly
4. **üîç Startpage** - Google results without tracking
5. **üèõÔ∏è CSE Direct** - Direct search of CSE website (planned)
